                During his time as a delegate, Tim has gained a profusion of debating skills and also has been able to make lifelong connections with people around the world, through a multitude of stunning conferences.</p><p class="indent">
                In his spare time, Tim can be found at the gym, pumping that iron, flying around and buzzing towers in downtown, or be seen at the theaters watching new cinematic films.

                Through MUN, Alice has gained a much deeper and more insightful understanding of international issues, diplomacy and foreign affairs.
                Aside from MUN and public speaking, Alice loves volunteering, drawing, reading, and delving into to the world of STEM.
                She is absolutely delighted to be serving as the Chief of Staff at PacificMUN 2017.</p><p class="indent">

                Joining Model United Nations in Grade 10, it has fostered many opportunities for Christopher, as well as deepened his understanding in world politics and international affairs.
                Having attended over 15 conferences, both hotel and day as a delegate, staff member and Secretariat member, Christopher hopes to successfully create a great environment for those attending PacificMUN 2017.

                Two of the things about MUN that Chris values most is the amount of knowledge people can gain, and also the friendships he made every time he was at a conference.
                Outside of MUN, you might find Chris roaming around the city at different coffee shops and restaurants, hanging out with friends, or playing various sports such as lacrosse, swimming and track.
                Christopher looks forward to PacificMUN 2017 in March, and hopes to create an empowering experience for sponsor-teachers and delegates of all skill levels.</p>

                Elizabeth has, and continues to attend conferences both locally and internationally, but when not at conferences, she is involved with the public speaking club and choir at her school.</p><p class="indent">
                In her spare time, Elizabeth enjoys playing piano and her ukulele, volunteering, exploring bookstores, and spending time with her friends and family. Ever since her love for debate was sparked, Model UN has been one of Elizabeth's favorite pursuits, and she is ecstatic to work with the rest of her team to create the best possible conference experience for delegates, staff, and sponsor teachers alike.
                Elizabeth is excited to meet PacificMUN's delegates in March, and hopes to ignite in them a passion for Model UN, just like her first conference did for her.

                Discovering the world of Model United Nations in Grade 9, Charles had no idea what he was going into as a young student or how important MUN would be in his life.
                Serving previously as a delegate, staff and Secretariat member, Charles is honoured to be one of the USGs of Committees to introduce the Model UN community to new and exciting committees as well as interesting and significant topics relevant to our modern lifestyles.</p><p class="indent">
                Other than Model United Nations, Charles can often be found furiously planning out club meetings at school, working with different non-profits, or going around Surrey and Vancouver with friends.
                Throughout much of Charles' MUN career he has met many individuals who he is very proud to call his friends. 
                Of all the things that Charles values in MUN, he has found the networking aspect of every debate the best because of all the opportunities that it can bring to virtually all of the students who fully participate.
                Charles invites all delegates new to Model United Nations or those curious about why their friends dress up in suits 4 times a year to attend PacificMUN 2017!
                The staff and Secretariat team have been working hard to cater this experience to all delegates, and he looks forward to meeting all delegates!</p>

                Ever since his first conference, being the member of a Secretariat team and organizing a conference to be enjoyed by delegates has been a goal of Alan’s, and he hopes to fulfill that goal by providing the best experience possible at PacificMUN 2017.</p><p class="indent">
                When he is not involved in Model UN, Alan can be found doing a variety of activities such as competitive debate, Reach for the Top, organizing events, and professional procrastination.
