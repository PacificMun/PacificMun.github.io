   <!-- Committee Overview -->
    <div class="ComOverview container">
        <p class="indent">
            The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is the most prominent of six principal organs that are tasked with maintaining international peace and security.  As defined by the UN charter, the role of the UN in ensuring the collective security of nations, mandates the UNSC to recommend peaceful procedures to settle disputes between various parties, but also, allows the council to reserve the power to call for military intervention through the passing of resolutions.  As a result to the catastrophic loss of life from World War I, the Paris Conference established the League of Nations to maintain and ensure peace between nations.  This group would later serve as the foundation for the creation of the UNSC in 1945, as an executive branch within the U.N.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            With the ratification of the UNSC within the UN charter, the council is mandated with investigating disputes and recommending methods to outline terms of settlement to ensure international peace.  As such, this council has the ability to call upon nations to completely interrupt economic relations and communication channels between one another.  Having the ability to deploy U.N peacekeeping forces, this committee also has the ability to enforce various decisions militarily.  The UNSC is also the only council with the ability to create binding resolutions within the U.N.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            The council is comprised of fifteen member states with  five permanent members and ten elected members.  The five permanent members are: the United States, the Russian Federation, China, France and the United Kingdom.  These states reserve the right to veto resolutions.  The council’s ten elected members serve two-year terms and do not hold the right to veto.  These non-permanent members are elected by a two-thirds vote within the general assembly and are rendered eligible for candidacy if they contribute to the “maintenance of international security”.
  Various subsidiary organs also aid the UNSC in carrying out its mission such as, various ad hoc committees on counter-terrorism, biological warfare, chemical weapons etc.  Within the UN secretariat, there are also various departments that oversee on-the-ground operations that act as secondary organisations to the UNSC.   
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Being the executive committee within the United Nations, the UNSC has the responsibility to preliminarily recommend peaceful solution to solve crisis, however, they set forth the precedent for which the UN will intend to maintain security of nations.

                    My name is Julian Lam and I am a grade 11 student at Southpointe Academy.  MUN has always been an outlet that has enabled me to be a globally minded individual.  To be a part of a place where delegates develop solutions to  global problems and to meet the future leaders of tomorrow; it's inspiring.  I have been to more than 8 conferences over the course of 4 years.  I have represented the delegations of numerous nations in both specialized and general committees.  Outside of MUN, I enjoy playing tennis, debate and photography.  During my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family and exploring the great outdoors of B.C.

                    Kevin is a rising senior at Fraser Heights Secondary and is thrilled to be chairing the Security Council at PacificMUN 2017. Having been a delegate, staff member, and Model UN Captain at his school over the span of sixteen conferences, Model UN has become an invaluable part of his life. Kevin’s love for Model UN stems from its mix of individual empowerment and collaboration in world affairs. When not on the baseball field or volleyball court, Kevin is a passionate advocate for increasing minority representation in politics and universal access to education. You can often find Kevin in drinking iced coffee, catching up on Homeland or searching for his next good book. Kevin looks forward to creating an incredible delegate experience at PacMUN!
