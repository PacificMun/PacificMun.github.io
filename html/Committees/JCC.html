    <div class="ComOverview container">
        <p class="indent">
            JCC: The year is 2018. Quebec has seceded from Canada, becoming their own independent nation. A Cold War has erupted between these two nations, with the far-right Canadian Nationalist Front gaining power over the Canadian Parliament. With the backing of France and the European Union, La Republique Démocratique Du Québec (RDQ) has flourished, depressing the Canadian economy. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            After a new uranium deposit found in Quebec and military treaties signed between the RDQ and France, tensions are at an all-time high. Border skirmishes between the two countries’ militaries, Canada and Quebec, and announcements of support by their respective allies, the United States of America and France, bring these two nations on the brink of war.

                    International Baccalaureate program, and is thrilled to be serving as Bloc

                    doing MUN, Pranav enjoys *thinking *about MUN. His non-stop commitment to
                    the art of Model United Nations guarantees the success of this conference.
                    But beyond his love for MUN, Pranav also shares a love of meeting new

                    Emad Saberi is a senior at Port Moody Secondary School, and enjoys MUN almost as much as he does the IB diploma programme. Although he just started his second year of MUN, Emad has always been passionate about debate, diplomacy, and gavels. This has led him to serve as your Head Director of the Joint Crisis Committee at PacificMUN 2017. Outside of MUN, you can find him mountain biking, managing his extracurriculars, traveling, and writing school essays. He is excited to make PacificMUN 2017 a memorable conference for every attending delegate.

Her extensive involvement in the debate field and interest in international affairs has fostered her love for the world of Model UN. Having attended her first conference in the eighth grade, Jessica believes that engaging in MUN is a great opportunity for one to be aware of global issues, build speaking skills, and think critically. Jessica has great hopes in the prospects of this conference and wishes to make your JCC PacificMUN 2017 experience exuberant!

                    Curious, ambitious and full of high expectations, Linda Wu joined MUN in
                    grade 9. Ever since then, not only has MUN met and exceeded her hopes, it
                    has also introduced her to a brand new community: a community that is
                    aspiring and professional but also lively and unpredictable in the best
                    ways. As the Assistant Director for this year's JCC (French), she hopes to
                    help delegates experience the same environment she has had the privilege of
                    coming to know. Linda is a senior at Fraser Heights Secondary and in her
                    free time she enjoys getting Starbucks, writing and binge watching Youtube.
                    The most sincere best wishes for the delegates and may this year's
                    PacificMUN be the greatest one yet.

                    there. My first MUN conference was CAIMUN 2016, so as someone who is new to
                    the MUN world I’m really excited to contribute my ideas to a growing
                    conference like PacificMUN. Outside of MUN I’ve had a lot of leadership
                    experience through Student Government and I love to spend as much time as
                    possible travelling. Here’s to a incredible time at JCC French and a

He is thrilled for PacificMUN 2017 as it will be his first time staffing. Emmett first got involved with Model UN in Grade 11 after founding his school club and will do his best to support less experienced delegates, especially if they took the initiative to become the one of the first ever MUNers from their school as well! Besides MUN Emmett enjoys being involved with community centres and volunteering for political campaigns.

                    Winnie is a senior student at Elgin Park Secondary and is very excited to serve as one of the many chairs for JCC. Having been involved with MUN for almost 3 years now, she truly believes that the skills, knowledge, and networks acquired through these invigorating academic simulations help empower youth to further understand the world's many intricacies and innovate beyond a classroom textbook. Outside of MUN, Winnie enjoys expressing herself artistically through motion and pipetting odd substances into eppendorfs. With the opportunities for challenge and growth offered at a raised platform, she hopes that all delegates can passionately interact with others and thoroughly enjoy their times at PacificMUN 2016!
