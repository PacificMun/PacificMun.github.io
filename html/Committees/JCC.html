                <p>Pranav is entering his grade 12 year at Seaquam Secondary as part of the
International Baccalaureate program, and is thrilled to be serving as Bloc
Director of the Joint Crisis Committee at PacificMun 2017. When he isn’t
doing MUN, Pranav enjoys *thinking *about MUN. His non-stop commitment to
the art of Model United Nations guarantees the success of this conference.
But beyond his love for MUN, Pranav also shares a love of meeting new
people. So don’t be afraid to stop by and engage in a friendly rap-battle!
Or say hi, that works too. Pranav looks forward to a great conference!</p>

Gabby enjoys playing field hockey, mountain biking, playing piano and wood working. She is very happy to be directing the Quebec bloc of JCC and believes it will be a great committee.</p>

                <p>Curious, ambitious and full of high expectations, Linda Wu joined MUN in
grade 9. Ever since then, not only has MUN met and exceeded her hopes, it
has also introduced her to a brand new community: a community that is
aspiring and professional but also lively and unpredictable in the best
ways. As the Assistant Director for this year's JCC (French), she hopes to
help delegates experience the same environment she has had the privilege of
coming to know. Linda is a senior at Fraser Heights Secondary and in her
free time she enjoys getting Starbucks, writing and binge watching Youtube.
The most sincere best wishes for the delegates and may this year's
PacificMUN be the greatest one yet.</p>

                <p>My name is Nick Williams and I’m in Grade 12 at Cariboo Hill
Secondary in Burnaby. I’m thrilled to be serving as the chair of JCC’s
French bloc at PacificMUN 2017, one of the most unique committees out
there. My first MUN conference was CAIMUN 2016, so as someone who is new to
the MUN world I’m really excited to contribute my ideas to a growing
conference like PacificMUN. Outside of MUN I’ve had a lot of leadership
experience through Student Government and I love to spend as much time as
possible travelling. Here’s to a incredible time at JCC French and a
memorable conference!</p>

                <p>Emmett Mark is a Grade 12 student at Hugh Boyd Secondary, a small and rather unknown public high school in Richmond. He is thrilled for PacificMUN 2017 as it will be his first time staffing. Emmett first got involved with Model UN in Grade 11 after founding his school club and will do his best to support less experienced delegates, especially if they took the initiative to become the one of the first ever MUNers from their school as well! Besides MUN Emmett enjoys being involved with community centres and volunteering for political campaigns. Emmett is looking forward to a welcoming and dynamic committee atmosphere; come up and say hi!</p>

                <p>Winnie is a senior student at Elgin Park Secondary and is very excited to serve as one of the many chairs for JCC. Having been involved with MUN for almost 3 years now, she truly believes that the skills, knowledge, and networks acquired through these invigorating academic simulations help empower youth to further understand the world's many intricacies and innovate beyond a classroom textbook. Outside of MUN, Winnie enjoys expressing herself artistically through motion and pipetting odd substances into eppendorfs. With the opportunities for challenge and growth offered at a raised platform, she hopes that all delegates can passionately interact with others and thoroughly enjoy their times at PacificMUN 2016!</p>
