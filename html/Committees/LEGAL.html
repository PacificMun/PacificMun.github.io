    <div class="ComOverview container">
        <p class="indent">
            LEGAL committee acts as the main UN organ for discussing legal questions in the General Assembly. LEGAL committee is the Sixth General Assembly that generally meets on an annual basis usually between September and late November. As a general assembly, all UN Member States are entitled to a voice in LEGAL. Unlike most general assemblies, the committee rarely passes resolutions through the standard voting procedure but most often passes resolutions unanimously. The Sixth Committee has the power to pass resolutions and provide recommendations to all other UN organs. This power does not apply to recommendations of peace and security which is left for the Security Council.

            Established in 1946, the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) was created as a department in the United Nations (UN). However in 1954, it was established in its own office. In 1967, the International Trade Law Branch was created to manage the exporting and importing of trade goods between nations, and to place a standard set of laws for the international community. By 1992, the Office for Ocean Affairs had broken off, leaving the Office of Legal Affairs which we have today. In respect to the international community, LEGAL deals with a variety of social and political issues that impact the global community. LEGAL’s governance extends over all organs of the UN and all 193 nations involved with LEGAL.

                    Matthew is currently a senior attending Vancouver College. He started his
                    MUN journey at the beginning of grade 10 and has loved it ever since. He is
                    very honoured and excited to be the chair for LEGAL at PacificMUN 2017. On
                    spare time, Matthew enjoys expressing his views on international issues as
                    well as partaking in debates with his fellow classmates. Being very
                    interested in legal studies, business and politics, you can find him
                    interning at a few downtown firms as well as being involved in political
                    campaigning. Outside of MUN, sports, and school, you can find him working
                    with many non-profit or charitable organizations. During his free
                    time, you can find him watching various k-dramas and cheesy martial arts
                    movies, taking really artsy photos on insta (hmu: @__mbr__), learning
                    multiple languages, and drinking lots of Starbucks to study through the
                    night.

                    Katie Philips is a grade 12 student at Little Flower Academy. She began
                    Model United Nations in grade 9 and has since attended conferences in
                    Boston and Montreal, as well as several local conferences in Vancouver.
                    Katie’s first Model UN conference ignited a passion for debate in her and
                    she hopes to be able to bring that same love and enthusiasm to both new and
                    veteran delegates alike, at PacificMUN 2017. Katie is delighted to be
                    Assistant Director for Legal and hopes to make it an exciting and memorable
                    committee. When not busy with MUN, school, or her job at Starbucks, Katie
                    loves to spend time with friends and family whenever possible.
