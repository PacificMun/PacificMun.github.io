        <p class="indent">
            The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is an intergovernmental body within the United Nations system held responsible for the promotion and protection of human rights and the avoidance of human rights violations. Created on March 15, 2006, the UNHRC replaced the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR). The Council is currently made up of 47 United Nations member states which are elected by the UN General Assembly. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent"
           >Any UN member state may be elected to the UNHRC if it receives an absolute majority of votes (97 members of the General Assembly). The elected member states serve 3-year terms and are required to come from a variety of geographical regions: 13 members from the African region, 13 members from the Asian region, 8 members from the Latin American and Caribbean region, 7 members from the Western European and Others region, and 6 members from the Eastern European region. A member state may be suspended by the UNHRC if it has committed an act of violating human rights. The suspension will be based on a vote by the General Assembly with a two-thirds majority in order to suspend. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            As a subsidiary body of the General Assembly, the UNHRC functions to help member states meet their human rights obligations through communication, assistance, and capacity building. The UNHRC assesses the human rights conditions of all 193 UN member states through the “Universal Periodic Review”. In addition, its work contains the “Complaint Procedure”, which allows individuals and organizations to bring complaints about human rights violations to the attention of the Council.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            The UNHRC makes recommendations to the General Assembly concerning the development of new laws addressing human rights. All 47 member states must cooperate to ensure that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is followed throughout the world.

                    Xudi is a grade 11 student at Pacific Academy and he is excited to, for the
                    first time, serve as the Director of UNHRC. After attending the debate club
                    in grade 6, Xudi sparked a passion for debate and world issues. He was able
                    to fulfill both in grade 9, when he participated in multiple MUN
                    conferences. Xudi really values the benefits MUN provides, such as
                    opportunities in speech and diplomacy. As an IB programme student, Xudi
                    enjoys listening to music and scrolling through the Internet in his spare
                    time. He also takes pleasure in playing sports like badminton and in
                    planning events as a part of the student government in his school. Xudi
                    looks forward to meeting every delegate and welcomes any questions about
                    the committee or the conference!

                    Kane is a senior currently attending Richmond Secondary School and is absolutely privileged to serve as the chair in the United Nations Human Rights Council. He has delegated and staffed many conferences since grade 9 and has loved every caucus. Outside of Model United Nations you can find him reading a good book, watching Suits, and playing his guitar. He is also very passionate about politics and law, having been to the Youth Summer program at the University of Toronto for Law and closely following the United States presidential election, even though he considers that more comedy than actual politics. He looks forward to an excellent conference and wishes delegates an amazing experience.

                    A sophomore at Semiahmoo Secondary, Judith is excited to be serving as your Assistant Director for UNHRC at PacificMUN 2017! Ever since her first Model UN conference in 2015, Judith has been captivated by the diplomacy, pragmatism and collaboration that MUN entails. Since then, MUN has encouraged her to foster her fervorous passions for international relations and debating. In addition, she believes that MUN is an excellent outlet to further understand current events, improve public speaking skills and meet like-minded youth. Outside of the exciting realm of MUN, Judith enjoys volleyball, ballet and event organization. However, one can also find Judith scrolling through memes and binge watching Modern Family in her spare time. All in all, Judith looks forward to creating an enriching and memorable experience at PacificMUN for new and experienced delegates alike!
