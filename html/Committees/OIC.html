        <p class="indent">
            The OIC consists of 57 member states with each respective state acting to represent their country in the OIC. In 2008 the present charter was adopted by the eleventh Islamic session,  which laid down the principles and objectives of the organization. As a result, this charter unifies the OIC under one umbrella of “Strengthening Solidarity”. Each member state must abide by the OIC. The OIC consists of many different organs, each with the purpose of strengthening relations between its member states.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            The “Standing Committee,” which is one of the organs, consists of the following; The Al Quds Committee, The Standing Committee of Information and Cultural Affairs (COMIAC), The Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation (COMCEC), and lastly The Standing Committee for Scientific and Technological cooperation (COMSTECH). Delegates should be aware of “The Standing Committee,” which is significant for the OIC as it strengthens the links between its member states, and in-order to advance issues of critical importance to the organization. The OIC’s 57 members are spread throughout four continents. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            In-order to protect the interests of Muslims and to re-solve any rivalry between member states, the OIC’s relation with the United Nations and other bodies/organizations is consultative and cooperative.

                    Carol is a Grade 12 student currently attending R.A.McMath Secondary and has been an active participant in Model United Nations since coming to Canada in Grade 9. She has developed an ardent passion for international relations and has gained much from the enlightening experiences that MUN offers. For Carol, Model UN is an opportunity to meet like minded people and to forge connections. It is a community that expands on the conviction that our generation can make a difference through joint endeavors. Besides being president of McMath's Model UN club, Carol also takes on leadership roles in several charity organizations and her school's Student Council. She enjoys high tea, BBC mini-TV series and adventures abroad. When she is not debating economic issues around the world, you can find her reading Jane Austen and detective novels. Carol is thrilled to welcome all delegates to Organization of Islamic Cooperation and looks forward to a rewarding experience at PacificMUN 2017.
