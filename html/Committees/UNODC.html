    <div class="ComOverview container">
        <p class="indent">
            Since 1997, through a merge of the United Nations Drug Control Programme and the Centre for International Crime Prevention, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has become a global leader in the fight against illicit drugs and international crime. The UNODC operates in numerous field offices located around the world where it is mandated to help member states in the fight against drugs, crime, and terrorism. Employing around 2000 people worldwide and with its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, the office also has two liaison offices located in Brussels and New York City. With an estimated biannual budget of US$700 million in the 2016-2017 year and no military force, the UNODC relies heavily on support from member countries for funding.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            In the Millennium Declaration, one of the goals of the UNODC was to strengthen attempts of fighting transnational and international crime, along with countering the world drug problem. 
            The UNODC’s work programme can be summarized in its three pillars. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            First, they work to counteract illicit drugs and crime through field-based technical cooperation projects in member countries which overall allow member states to better contribute against the flow of crime and drugs. Second, to broaden our knowledge base and understanding of these issues based on research, analytical work, and evidence based study of implemented policies. Lastly, this office strives to assist states in the ratification and implementation of international treaties regarding the control of crime and drugs through both international and domestic legislation.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            The main goals of the UNODC are to help better equip governments to handle crime and drug related issues in the long run while mitigating existing problems in the short term. In the pursuit of these objectives, the UNODC looks particularly at the problems surrounding and stemming from these issues such as human trafficking and the ability of alternative livelihoods for those countries and citizens reliant on drugs. Some of the main themes the UNODC deals with include corruption, criminal justice, drug prevention, and alternate development.

                    Brandon is currently a Grade 11 student at St. George’s School and he is thrilled to serve as the Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime at PacificMUN 2017. He attended his first conference a few years ago and has been fascinated in world affairs and diplomacy ever since. After many conferences and caucuses, Brandon sees the importance of Model UN because it not only allows participants to broaden their perspective of the world, but also helps develop rhetoric and critical thinking skills. His extracurricular interests include debating, eating, pretending to cook, and playing percussion. Brandon procrastinates by practicing piano, sleeping, and joining non-profit organizations. Brandon cannot wait to meet all the delegates at the conference, and hopes that it will be an unforgettable experience.

                    Rachel is currently a senior at Burnaby North Secondary and is honoured to be serving as the Chair for the UNODC at PacificMUN 2017. Rachel has continuously shown her passion for global issues and debate ever since attending her first Model UN conference in Grade 9. Not only has Model UN provided an amazing learning experience for Rachel, but it has also allowed her to meet many different people from around the world, and has given her plenty of new opportunities. Outside of Model UN, Rachel can be seen volunteering in her community, working alongside organizations/clubs, jamming to music, socializing with her beloved friends, and catching a snooze whenever she can.  Rachel can't wait until PacificMUN 2017, and hopes to see you all there!

                    Angela is currently a grade 11 student studying at Crofton House School.
                    Ever since joining the Model United Nations Club in the grade eight, Angela
                    has developed a strong passion for debate and current events. Although shy
                    at first, Angela began to gain greater self-confidence and public speaking
                    skills by submerging herself in the MUN community. Through Pacific MUN,
                    Angela hopes to, similarly, inspire young people to become more aware and
                    knowledgeable about current events and issues, while also developing
                    confidence. Beyond MUN, Angela can be found doing a lot of charity work,
                    drawing or playing tennis with her friends. Eager to serve as assistant
                    director for UNODC, Angela looks forward to meeting all of you!
