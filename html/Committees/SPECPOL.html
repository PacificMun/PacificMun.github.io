    <!-- Committee Overview -->
    <div class="ComOverview container">
        <h1 class="Comh1Title">SPECPOL</h1>
        <p class="indent">The Special Political and Decolonization Committee, or SPECPOL is the Fourth Committee of the General Assemblies of the United Nations (UN). It was established in 1993, with its mandate focused on “subjects related to decolonization, Palestinian refugees and human rights, mine action, outer space, public information, atomic radiation and University for Peace.”  Including all 193 Member States, SPECOL is united in helping alleviate developing countries’ dependence on former colonizing powers. It has ties to the Special Political Committee formed in 1947 dealing with issues relating to international politics and security. SPECPOL was an ad-hoc committee until 1978, when it became the Fourth Committee after replacing the Trusteeship Committee. When the United Nations declared the time period of 1990-2000 to be the “International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism,” SPECPOL was formally modified to become the Special Political and Decolonization Committee. </p>
        <p class="indent">This committee is an advisory committee, following the trend of the other General Assembly Committees. SPECPOL recommends courses of action to the other specialized agencies, governments of members states, international and nongovernmental organizations, and the Security Council. It does not have the arbitrated power to pass a binding resolution nor take military action in any circumstance. </p>
        <p class="indent">The Special Political and Decolonization Committee has a specific and unique role in the scope of the United Nations. While many other committees have a goal of resolving current global issues, SPECPOL aims to heal countries from the impact of colonization and other troubles in the past. The objective of this committee is to bring forth the benefits of independence and self-reliance that have been hidden in the shadows of many countries, and ensure that all countries worldwide are economically, culturally, and socially liberated. </p>

                    Entering his senior year as a student of Vancouver College, Rio Leung is deeply passionate about Model United Nations and its pursuit of inspiring diplomacy. Rio has been an active member of the Model United Nations community for year and a half, and has since delegated and staffed at numerous hotel and day conferences. Outside of his academic life, Rio dedicates himself to his work with Saint John’s Ambulance and various sports, including golf, volleyball and ultimate. In his spare time, you can find Rio writing, "studying", and watching ‘just one more’ Netflix Original Series. As well, if you strike up a conversation with him, he will tell you all about his many theories of life, and how he has become the absolute master of procrastination from a young age. He wishes all delegates in SPECPOL a meaningful committee experience, and hopes that PacificMUN will be a memorable conference for all.

                    Hey everyone! My name is Kelly and I'm currently a Grade 11 student at Crofton House School. Since Grade 8, I have attended 6 MUN conferences and have enjoyed all of them. Outside of MUN, I enjoy playing tennis, shopping, dancing, and hanging out with my friends. I am thrilled to be the assistant director of SPECPOL this year! Feel free to approach me throughout the conference with questions, concerns, or even just to talk.
