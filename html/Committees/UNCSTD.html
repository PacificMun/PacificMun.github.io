                    Edward Luo is currently a Grade 12 student attending Fraser Heights
                    Secondary School. Started in Grade 10, Edward found his passion for MUN, an
                    activity that had broadened his knowledge and helped him develop strong
                    interpersonal skills. Having a passion in science, Edward is a part of the
                    Science Academy program at his school and has been involved with the
                    Greater Vancouver High School Science Association since grade 9. Edward is
                    honored to serve as the Director of the United Nations Commission on
                    Science and Technology for Development committee. He sincerely hopes that
                    PacificMUN 2017 will be as enriching, engaging, and inspiring experience to
                    all delegates.

                    Currently a grade 11 student, Danica is captivated by the world of politics and diplomacy, and is ecstatic to be serving as the Chair of UNCSTD. As a part of the Model UN club at Richmond Christian School, Danica has been attending MUN conferences ever since Grade 9, with her first conference being CAHSMUN 2015. Truly impacted by the resolutions and positive ideas formulated in committee sessions, Danica became determined to seek out these solutions outside the committee room through becoming involved in various non-profit organizations. From working as the Executive Director of Human Resources at Kindlers Society to serving as Vice President of UNITE, Danica consistently strives to make positive changes in the world and aid the global community. Outside of MUN and her non-profit work, Danica enjoys participating in the Student and Leadership Team at her school, singing, and reading pointless conspiracy theories. Danica is honoured to help delegates begin or further develop their Model UN career and is looking forward to a conference filled with intense debate, collaboration, communication, and compromise.

                    Semeion is currently a grade 11 student attending R.A. McMath Secondary and is ecstatic to serve as the assistant director for the UNCSTD at PacificMUN 2017. Since attending her first conference in grade 10, Semeion has become infatuated with international relations and public speaking. Aside from Model UN conferences, you can probably find her explaining how to pronounce her name or slamming on buzzers at Reach for the Top tournaments. Additionally, you can find her debating on whether she wants to be a lawyer or a surgeon, depending on whether she's watching Suits or Grey's Anatomy at the moment.
