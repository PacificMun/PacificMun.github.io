    <!-- Committee Overview -->
    <div class="ComOverview container">
        <p class="indent">
            The United Nations Space Command  is a fictitious committee created solely to highlight the importance and raise awareness on the increasingly prevalent issues of space and the potential future that earth could face should we continue on with some of the trends that we have seen so far. The creation of the UN Space Command was first manufactured post-World War II on the premise of creating a political and militaristic international administrative body to assist in various problems affecting the planet. But, as time progressed and technology advanced, the United Nations Space Command began to discover the importance of investing in space research and thus developed the International Society of Civil Engineers in 2021, to further the developments of space travel.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Today, the United Nations Space Command, along with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, lead the world in solving newly arisen problems related to international and interplanetary affairs. The UN Space Command has spearheaded many policies of colonization and human settlement as well as maintained and amended previous treaties on the international policies regarding resource and territorial affairs in outer space since 2016. These feats of international and interplanetary cooperation can only be achieved in such a diverse assembly of 40 member state delegates, who welcomed into this ever growing committee that is facing new obstacles in the worsening conditions of planet Earth.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            The United Nations Space Command will offer a more challenging, engaging and unique type of committee experience for any interested delegates. Position papers are recommended for this committee but are mandatory for all delegates to be considered for awards at the end of the conference.

                    Germaine is currently a senior at Little Flower Academy and will serve as
director of UN Space Command. She has been a Model UN leader at LFA for
three years and have participated in a whirlwind of conferences all over
the world. Her favourite conference to date has been HarvardMUNCHINA 2016,
where she was given the opportunity to visit Beijing, Xian and Shanghai
with her school. When she is not found power walking around a conference,
you will probably discover her either bent over a circuit board, reading
one of her favourite books or sprinting after a disc. Germaine is
thoroughly excited for PACIFICMUN2017 and cannot wait to meet you all in
committee!
