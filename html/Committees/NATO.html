    <!-- Committee Overview -->
    <div class="ComOverview container">
        <h1 class="Comh1">NATO</h1>
        <p>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was originally established on April 4th, 1949 as an intergovernmental military alliance between 12 founding member states to prevent the proliferation of communist ideologies of the former Soviet Union (USSR). </p>
        <p>Since the collapse of the USSR in 1991 at the end of the Cold War, although NATO lost its historical purpose for having existed, NATO has transitioned its goal to safeguarding the freedom and security of its current 28 member states in Europe and North America. Outlined by NATOâ€™s 2010 Strategic Concept, the three fundamental objectives of the North Atlantic Alliance, created for the purposes of safeguarding Alliance members in the interests of international law, include, but are not limited to: (1) the guarantee of collective defence as a primary mechanism of defence amongst member nations, (2) the continuation of overseas crisis management of issues that potentially undermine the interests of the alliance, and (3) the provision of cooperative security amongst neighbours and international partners on grounds of common concern. As enshrined in Article 4 of the Washington Treaty, NATO uniquely remains as the sole organization in which parties collectively come together to discuss all issues of contention that impact the territorial integrity, political, independence and/or security of its members.</p>

                <p class="staffp">Director</p>
                <p>Woojin Lim is currently a grade eleven student at Fraser Heights Secondary. As
an active public speaker deeply interested in global issues, philosophy,
and criminal law, Woojin rekindled his interest in Model United Nations in
his sophomore year. Woojin believes that MUN is a unique platform for
delegates to expand their knowledge of international affairs. Outside of
MUN, Woojin volunteers for various nonprofit organizations, serves as a
freelance ensemble violinist, and continues to write eloquent poetry synced
with hip hop music. Woojin strongly encourages all delegates to attend the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization at PacificMUN 2017 for an unforgettable
experience!</p>

                <p>Nathan Shao is a Grade 11 IB student at Port Moody Secondary School. He is
honoured to serve as the Chair of the US Senate. Ever since attending his
first MUN club meeting as his school, Nathan has been an eager participant
ever since. He believes that MUN is a great opportunity for delegates to
network and meet other enthusiastic students. Outside of MUN, Nathan can be
found playing in chess tournaments, performing in piano recitals,
snowboarding on the local mountains or playing basketball with friends.
Nathan hopes that PacificMUN 2017 will be an innovative and memorable
experience for all delegates.</p>
