    <!-- Committee Overview -->
    <div class="ComOverview container">
        <p class="indent">DISEC was created to deal with disarmament, global challenges and threats to peace. It is meant to keep the international community safe and peaceful by using solutions in the international security regime. The General Assembly was formed in 1945 when the United Nation (UN) Charter was first ratified. The General Assembly is one the main 6 organs of the UN and is the main deliberative, policymaking, and representative organ of the UN. Each country has one vote in any General Assembly, and will consist of every member of the UN. Important matters such as those on peace and security, admission of new members, or budgetary matters, require two thirds majority. Other simpler matters only require simple majority. </p>
        <p class="indent">DISEC is considered to play a major role in the General Assembly's. The phrase “international peace and security” is mentioned six times in Chapter IV of the UN Charter. DISEC however does not hold the power to impose sanctions or allow for armed intervention. It does however, hold the authority to initiate studies and pass resolutions for the purpose of international political cooperation as well as “the development and codification of international law.” In a quick synopsis, DISEC cannot require countries to take a specific action. It can however make recommendations to the Security Council. </p>

                    Dunstan has learned his ABC's and 123's. Ever since, he has always been passionate about world issues and debate, both which Model UN include. He joined the MUN world in Grade 8 and has been actively involved in it as much as possible. Outside of MUN, he can be found playing around on one of the many instruments that happen to be near him. Dunstan currently spends a lot of his time at a music store partly because he loves it there and partly because he works there. He currently attends Grade 11 at Fraser Heights Secondary and is absolutely delighted to serve as your director for DISEC.

                    Edward is currently a senior at St.Georges School. He attended his first MUN conference in San Francisco three years ago, and ever since he has loved every aspect of MUN. Edward wastes 99% of his time on fantasy hockey, PoGo, Chel, Facebook and other useless activities that will definitely not be helping him get into university. In the other 1% of the time when he isn’t wasting his time - he plays Tennis, Field Hockey, and Soccer; and is heavily involved in Service. One thing Edward dislikes, or rather hates is spiders. Edward has a quite rational fear of spiders, especially when they are raining from the sky (Australia…). Edward is looking forward to staffing at PacificMUN!

                    Rachel Chok is a junior at J.N. Burnett Secondary School and is notorious for her atrocious use of puns, but nonetheless promises to bring utter professionalism to the dias as an Assistant Director. Her favourite memories lie in DISEC -of course-, a committee filled with fast-paced debate and diplomacy. She hopes to inspire her delegates to develop a passion for global issues. Aside from Model UN, Rachel has a penchant for nature, and can be found mountain biking or rafting down level 2 rapids. Rachel is honoured to staff at PacificMUN and wishes all delegates the best of luck.
