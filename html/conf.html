        <h2>A Whole New Meaning </h2><br>
        <p class="indent">Pacific Model United Nations 2017 is the newest hotel conference in the Lower Mainland, changing the MUN scene for the better. It is built upon three main pillars: Affordability, Education, and being a Social Catalyst. Many students across the Lower Mainland have found themselves unable to attend Model United Nations conferences, because of the steep price. PacificMUN has placed a priority on being affordable, and is proud to say that it is the most affordable hotel Model United Nations program in North America. 
        </p><br>
        <p class="indent">The conference would also like delegates to learn something out of the conference, if it either be about a global issue that is facing many nations, or about themselves as a person, and how they interact with people. Pacific Model United Nations is a safe place for delegates to learn about whatever they choose to learn about, having a wide variety of committees so that anyone with any kind of interests can attend. Lastly, delegates can come to PacificMUN and meet many different people. Since there is a large array of delegates, everyone is bound to meet people with similar interests as their own. This also helps delegates push past their comfort zone and make new friends that they wouldn’t have made before. Pacific Model United Nations 2017 is bound to be an exceptional conference, and will make sure that delegates can have fun, while learning as much as they can.

                        In the past, socials at Model United Nations conferences were intended to allow delegates to meet, network, and have fun with each other in a non-professional setting, but somewhere along the way, we felt that this original intention got left behind. We hope to bring that back again with our signature gala social, Aurora. Compared to the socials that other Model United Nations conferences have, Aurora is PacificMUN’s bold take on a classic idea.

                        Taking place on the 19th floor of the Pinnacle in the Vistas 360 room, this space gives panoramic views of Downtown Vancouver, the North Shore, and Vancouver Harbour as it rotates once every 60 minutes. A black-tie event, this social will be supplied with copious amounts of hors d'oeuvres, desserts, and (non-alcoholic) drinks that should make delegates enjoy our social that much more.

We hope that Aurora will be the beginning of a new dawn of socials, and with a dazzling display of photos, food, and fun, Aurora is an event you don’t want to miss!</p>

        <p>From luxurious guest rooms to spacious meeting rooms, the Pinnacle Harbourfront Hotel is the ideal location for PacificMUN 2017. With views across both the harbour front and the heart of downtown Vancouver, one would be wondering what could ever be wrong in the beautiful city. However, the real Pinnacle difference is not what they have but what they do, making every guest experience special with personalized service, thoughtful extras and unwavering attention to detail. It is also located just steps away from some of the greatest restaurants in all of Vancouver. The variety of cuisine in downtown Vancouver is also quite vast, with fast food chains such as McDonalds for those that want a quick bite, or fine dining restaurants such as Prestons for those craving the finer things in life. Downtown has a place for everyone to eat, you just need to find it. </p>
